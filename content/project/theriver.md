__About This Project__  
_The River_ is a light sculpture inspired by the beauty and history of the Singapore River. It consists of several laser cut acrylic sheets illuminated by 72 LEDs, taking on the shape of the Singapore River as seen from a map. The light animation is programmed based on an analysis of sound samples recorded along the Singapore River.
 
 ArtMakesUs made this sculpture during their second year as Interactive Art students from LASALLE College of the Arts, under the supervision of their lecturer Andreas Schlegel. It was exhibited at i Light Marina Bay 2012, a sustainable light festival held at Marina Bay, Singapore.
  
  The River is created in celebration of Asia’s only sustainable light festival and also in accordance with the theme of “Light Meets Asia”.
   
   Focusing on the idea of “Light as Life”, the concept of the artwork is based on the idea that the Singapore River is a microcosm of Singapore, transforming with Singapore over the years and reflective of its identity today. The light animation based on sound samples collected over a day symbolises the daily activities along the river.

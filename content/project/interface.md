__About This Project__
nterface is a multi-disciplinary collaborative project that explores the symbiosis between interactive media and dance performance. Based on contextual research, custom-made technology is used to translate body movement and site-specific spaces into audio-visual expressions. In each performance installation by Level 2 BA(Hons) dance students, interactive technology synergises with dance choreography as an expressive tool.

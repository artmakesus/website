__About This Project__  
_COCK_ by Mike Bartlett is a theatre production presented by the Buds Theatre Company and directed by Rayann Condy. It was shown at Singapore Drama Centre, Black Box, on 10 -12 MAY 2012.
 
ArtMakesUs created the projection mapping visual effects for certain scene transitions in the play. The visual concept is based on the idea that the set reflects the state of mind of the protagonist – John, with waves signifying the passing of time or sexual activity in the style of a wire frame. The visual effects were created using an open source software called Processing.

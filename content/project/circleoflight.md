__About This Project__  
_Circle of Light_ is photography booth where users can take their own photos while selecting a light painted image and/or text as a photo background and share them on their favourite social networks.
 
 The setup includes a LPD8806 64-LED strip hooked onto a wooden stick which is rotated by a servo motor controlled by an Arduino. A computer acts as a web app server for users to send images / text from their own machines (mobile phones or PCs). The server receives the assets sent by the user, sends the data to the Arduino for display and triggers the camera capture.

__About This Project__
Abstraction is a performance installation inspired by avant garde British theatre group Complicite’s A Disappearing Number. Key themes explored include the beauty of mathematics, a cultural collision of East and West, and the interconnectedness of human relationships. Conceptualised as visual pageantry and drawing references from leading contemporary artists like Robert Wilson and Robert Lepage, this work seeks to explore new perspectives in medium accessible to audiences in the 21st Century.
 
 Merging real-time technology with live performance, this innovation in theatre questions the line between theatrical conventions and new media art. Abstraction aims to leave a deep impression in the audience’s mind as to how seemingly disparate themes of love and mathematics can be beautifully intertwined into a story. Abstraction is a collaboration by students from Theatre+Performance, Acting and Interactive Art at LASALLE College of the Arts.

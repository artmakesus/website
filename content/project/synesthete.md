__About This Project__  
_The Synaesthete’s Music Box_ is a sound machine inspired by the idea of synesthesia. A synesthete is someone who perceives secondary sensations involuntarily through another sensory stimulation. For example, a synesthete will “see” explosions of colour in his mind when listening to loud music, or ‘hear’ sounds in his head when viewing a painting.
 
 This music box converts colours into sound. A webcam sees the colours on the turntable. A custom program then interprets the image in real time to trigger sounds. Play around with different colour arrangements to create your own unique sounds.
